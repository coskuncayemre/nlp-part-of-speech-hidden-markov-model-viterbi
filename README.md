NLP - PoS Tagging HMM with Viterbi Algorithm

Aim

The main aim of this assignment is to use the pairs in the training data to find the tags of the words by applying Part-Of-Speech,Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi Algorithm on the test data.



Task I : Building a Bigram Hidden Markov Model

Task II : Viterbi Algorithm with Good Turing Smoothing

Task III : Evaluation
